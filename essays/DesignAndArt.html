My entire life I have been fascinated with design, detail, and art. The texture of walls, the white fluffy floating lakes and oceans of water suspended in our skies. The mesmermizing galaxies and nebulas in our unpolluted nights. As I grow as an artist, so does my appreciation, and fascination with design. With podcasts such as 99 Percent Invisible giving me deeper looks into unacknowledged design, and my expanding interest into design of all types. Science of smell, sound design, tactile design, accesibility. Ways to trick the mind, ways to enhance sensation. Any art I want to make, stories, pictures, movies, games. No matter how basic, I cant be helped but put some sort of design into it from my research into it.</p>

<p>My current major works include a game project named Attack On The Planet Ink, and a story project called Against Creation. Both take deep looks into design in starkly different ways. Against Creation is a narrative (Planned to be a TV series, due to it being way to lengthy for a movie, or even several) following several main characters throughout a long an ever changing story. All focusing on philosophical concepts, and deep questions. Questions of morality, conciousness, what is alive, what does it mean to be alive? Every step of the journey questioning what you think is reality, and what is right. With comeplling and relateable characters who face difficult and real challenges, as well as horrifying eldritch terrors that grow beneath them, and sometimes from them. With a look into the future, and a cautionary tale of what may happen if humanity ignores these many simple, but difficult questions.</p>

<p>Attack On The Planet Ink is a video game project where you play as a virally colonial alien species who is to take down an alien threat. Your character is a young soldier of a particularly weak species. A one legged, one eyed alien who stands tall, and thinks very little. As the narrative progresses, very harsh realities unfurl. It becomes increasingly obvious the aliens being invaded are not at all evil, and at worst are only defending themselves. Many helplessly slaughtered by the invaders. Even worse, your own species, are children. Several thousands of soldiers who have not even reached puberty, and can barely grasp the gravity of the situation. Being carried on by the enslaved aliens of previous wars on other invaded planets. While the “enemy” aliens frantically scramble to modify and engineer their own super soldiers as a last ditch effort to save their own way of life.</p>
